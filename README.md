 \
This project is an example of how to use Scala with spring-boot. \
And it's a simple example but shows how Scala looks like in Gradle projects. \
 \
Make sure you have installed the JDK, Gradle, and Scala on your machine, if you use IntelliJ, you can use the plugins. \
Run the project: \
``
./gradlew clean 
``

``
